### Step 0 (Preparations)
Install python from [the Microsoft store](https://apps.microsoft.com/search?query=python) or [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
### Step 1 (Install requirements)
Extract the zip and navigate into the folder, then type `cmd` into the navigation bar, or alternatively if you are on a Unix based system (Linux, OS X) then open your terminal and navigate to the folder with the cd command.

Now, type:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all requirements
### Step 2 (Launch)
After the installation, run:
```
python app.py
```
to start the script. If you are planning to use the script more than one it is recommended to create a start-up script or exe for faster and easier access, see [[Shortcuts|here]].
